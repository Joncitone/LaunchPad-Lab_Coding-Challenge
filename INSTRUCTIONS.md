LaunchPad Lab is evaluating new client-side Javascript frameworks. To choose the "winning" technology, we need to compare development activity, community support, stability, and any other relevant information. We will want to be able to sort and compare the data, but are open to any UI that you feel will facilitate our decision.

Your challenge is to create a dashboard that helps us make the right choice based on GitHub activity (GitHub API - https://docs.github.com/v3/) for the following frameworks:

React: https://github.com/facebook/react
Angular: https://github.com/angular/angular.js
Ember: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/
Vue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue
To really get a sense of how active development is on these frameworks, we need to be able to see updates to the dashboard without a page refresh (do not worry about API rate limits for this challenge). Please choose the 3 most relevant pieces of information from the following:

Watchers
Stars
Forks
Commits
Pull requests
Issues
Etcâ€¦
For this exercise, you can use any Javascript framework you would like (ex. Angular, Ember, React, Vue, etc...). We're not worried about custom visual design for this challenge, so feel free to keep it pretty basic. You can use any CSS framework, or roll your own CSS. Your submission will be judged based on:

Fulfilling the requirements above
Helping us choose the right framework
Code quality
Ease of extending codebase to support other frameworks and comparison attributes
Your overall thought process (add your notes to a Readme)
We're hoping that you can finish the challenge within 7 days. Please push your code to Github and deploy to your hosting provider of choice and share the links for both when you're done.

Please let me know if you have any questions and good luck!
